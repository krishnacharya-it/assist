            Krishna has 8 years of experience in full-stack development, working with technologies like React.js, Django, and PHP.
            Over the years, he’s developed and maintained more than 7 internal applications, mostly aimed at improving organizational workflows and efficiency. He’s handled both frontend and backend responsibilities — from building responsive UIs in React.js to developing APIs and business logic in Django and PHP.
            He’s also worked on optimizing performance by implementing lazy loading and caching strategies to reduce server load. In one project for IDFC Bank, he helped avoid multiple unnecessary requests using advanced caching techniques.
            Apart from development, he’s contributed to setting up automated deployment using CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, integrated Jest testing for code quality, and participated in data migration tasks. He’s also mentored junior developers and conducted React.js training sessions internally.
            Overall, he’s passionate about building scalable and maintainable applications that solve real business problems.
